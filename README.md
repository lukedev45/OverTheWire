# OverTheWire Wargames

OverTheWire is a collection of online security and hacking challenges designed to teach practical cybersecurity skills through hands-on experience. Each challenge, or "wargame," presents players with progressively more complex problems that require understanding of topics such as Linux, networking, encryption, privilege escalation, and exploit development.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of OverTheWire is to provide a safe, legal, and educational environment for learning cybersecurity fundamentals. Rather than reading about theory, players actively apply their knowledge to solve real-world style puzzles — learning how systems work by breaking and fixing them.

## 🕹️ Popular Wargames

- **Bandit** — Focuses on basic Linux commands, file manipulation, and SSH. Perfect for beginners.  
- **Leviathan** — Introduces privilege escalation and binary exploitation concepts.  
- **Narnia** — Explores stack-based buffer overflows and simple C vulnerabilities.  
- **Krypton** — Covers classical cryptography such as Caesar and Vigenère ciphers.  
- **Natas** — A web-based series teaching web security, HTML injection, and authentication flaws.  

Each level gives you a small hint and a goal (e.g., “find the password for the next level”), pushing you to research and experiment until you find a solution.

## 🧠 Skills Developed

- Command-line proficiency  
- Secure shell (SSH) usage  
- File permissions and privilege escalation  
- Scripting and automation  
- Basic reverse engineering  
- Web and cryptography fundamentals
