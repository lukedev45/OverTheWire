Level 1: 3QJ3TgzHDq (grep "leviathan" bookmarks.html)
Level 2: NsN1HwFoyN (use ltrace and then look at strcmp library)
Level 3: f0n8h2iWLP (The printfile function can not read spaces, so we can create a file called "test file.txt" and then create a soft link to the password of leviathan 3 and then use printfile on "test file.txt". This reads the password because the printfile script calls the UID and grants permission (can be seen once you run ltrace ./printfile on a random file))
Level 4: WG1egElCvO (use ltrace and then look at strcmp library, password is snlprintf and then cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4)
Level 5: 0dyxT7F4QD (use a binary to ascii converter online, not the nicest way but will look into other ways soon)
Level 6: szo7HDB88w (Create a soft link called file.log in tmp to /etc/leviathan_pass/levaithan6 and then run the leviathan5 script)
